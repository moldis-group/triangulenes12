# content
CSV files with S<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>1</sub>, and S<sub>1</sub>-T<sub>1</sub> energies for all 12 triangular molecules calculated with different methods with `cc-pVDZ`, `cc-pVTZ`, `aug-cc-pVDZ` and `aug-cc-pVTZ` basis sets. 

For all systems, minimum energy geometries at the CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ level were used as reported in **Loos et al.** _J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 49, 11069-11075_ [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c03042](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.3c03042). These geometries are provided in the folder [XYZ](XYZ).
